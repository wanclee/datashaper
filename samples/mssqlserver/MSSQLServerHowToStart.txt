The sample XML files depend on the schema called ACTPROJ, which can be created by executing actproj-mssqlserver.ddl

Assuming you have the default server (yourMachineName\SQLEXPRESS) installed and running.
You will have to use sqlcmd (Sql Server command line tool) and Sql Server Management Studio (GUI tool).

Use the steps below to create ACTPROJ database and populate data with the sample XML files:

1. Login as host owner/user (who has Windows user account on the system) to default server by using Sql Server Management Studio. 
Create a new user 'actproj' with SQL Server Authentication option under yourMachineName\SQLEXPRESS->security->logins

2. After the user is created, login as 'actproj' to the server and proceed to create a new database 'actproj'

3. It is quite clumsy to create tables in one-shot in Management Studio as it doesn't support import of DDL script.
   3.1 You can use sqlcmd to create tables with the ddl file 'actproj-mssqlserver.ddl'.
   
   3.2 Connect to the default server (yourMachineName\SQLEXPRESS) with the command below:
        sqlcmd -U actproj -P actproj  -S tcp:localhost,1433
   
   3.3. Once connected, 1> appears.
   3.4 To show a list of commands:
        1> :help

   3.5 Specify that you want to use actproj database:
       1> use actproj
       2> go
   
   3.5 Cut and paste the DDL scripts from actproj-mssqlserver.ddl to create the tables in actproj.
   
   Note: if the tcp/ip connection attempt failed, double check and make sure Sql Server service is running 
   and the client protocol for tcp/ip is enabled.  Sql Server Configuration Manager is the GUI tool to do that.
   Also make sure the service is listening at port 1433. Do a 'netstat -a' in a DOS prompt and check if it is there.
    
6. Need help with sqlcmd command line option, type sqlcmd -?

7. Execute Command Line DataShaper in the installed directory to populate data in the database:
    
    Windows:
    java -classpath datashaper.jar;drivers\sqljdbc4.jar com.psrtoolkit.datashaper.DataShaper -c samples\mssqlserver\MSSQLServerExampleSimpleCreateCustomers.xml -u actproj -p actproj

    Linux:
    java -classpath datashaper.jar:drivers/sqljdbc4.jar com.psrtoolkit.datashaper.DataShaper -c samples/mssqlserver/MSSQLServerExampleSimpleCreateCustomers.xml -u actproj -p actproj
    
    (note: assuming you put the jdbc driver under \drivers in the installed directory)
